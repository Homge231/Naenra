# AGENTS.md — AI Agent Handoff Document

> **Read this first.** This document explains the full context of the Naenra project for any incoming AI agent. It covers what has been built, the design decisions made, what is still pending, and the rules you must follow when making changes.

---

## What is this project?

**Naenra (ARENA.ENG)** is a competitive web-based typing game. Players race against a 60-second timer answering fill-in-the-blank vocabulary questions. Before each match, they pick a **Support Core** — a power-up that changes how their score is calculated.

- **Frontend:** Vue 3 + TypeScript + Pinia + Tailwind CSS (`client/`)
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express + TypeScript + Supabase (`server/`)
- **Live:** https://naenra.xyz · **API:** https://api.naenra.xyz

## The Most Important Architectural Decision: Core Strategy Pattern

### The problem it solves

Before the refactor, every core's logic lived inside one big `calculateScore()` function in `gameController.ts`, and every core's visual behaviour lived as `if (isComboCore)` / `if (isOracleCore)` chains in `GameplayView.vue`. Every new core required editing two central files.

### The solution

Each core is now **self-contained**. The system uses the **Strategy Pattern**:

```
BaseCore (abstract)
  ├── NoCoreStrategy        → flat base points
  ├── ComboCoreStrategy     → streak bonus
  ├── OracleCoreStrategy    → hint reveal + penalty
  └── SpeedsterCoreStrategy → time-based scoring
  └── [FutureCore]Strategy  ← one new file, done ✅
```

**Adding a new core = 1 new file (BE) + 1 registry entry each side. That's it.**

### Backend files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `server/src/cores/BaseCore.ts` | Abstract class + `ScoringContext` + `ScoringResult` types |
| `server/src/cores/[Name]Strategy.ts` | One file per core, implements `calculateCorrect(ctx)` |
| `server/src/cores/index.ts` | **Registry** — maps core name → strategy. Edit here to add cores. |

### Frontend files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `client/src/game/cores/BaseCore.ts` | `CoreModule` interface definition |
| `client/src/game/cores/registry.ts` | **Registry** — maps Supabase UUID → UI config. Edit here to add cores. |

### How GameplayView.vue uses it

```ts
// Single computed — no more hardcoded UUIDs in the view
const activeCoreModule = computed(() => getCoreModule(gameStore.activeCoreId))

// Template bindings become data-driven:
// :class="activeCoreModule.timerColor"
// :class="activeCoreModule.timerClass"
// v-if="activeCoreModule.showWindOverlay"
// popupType = activeCoreModule.popupType
```

## Scoring Logic (How Points Work)

### Correct answer flow

1. `submitAnswer()` in `gameController.ts` receives `{ answer, time_taken, current_combo, active_core_id, oracle_reveal_level }`
2. Validates session ownership + anti-cheat (core ID must match session's stored core)
3. Fetches core row from DB (`flat_buff`, `multiplier_buff`, `name`)
4. Calls `runScoring(isCorrect, core.name, ctx)` from `server/src/cores/index.ts`
5. `getCoreStrategy(core.name)` finds the right strategy class
6. `strategy.calculateCorrect(ctx)` or `strategy.calculateWrong(ctx)` returns `{ pointsDelta, breakdown }`
7. Score is updated in `game_sessions`, answer recorded in `game_session_answers`

### Core formulas

```
No Core / Combo Core:
  pointsDelta = floor( (100 + comboBonus + flat_buff) × multiplier_buff ) − oraclePenalty
  comboBonus  = min(combo × 10, 100)   [only for Combo Core, 0 otherwise]

Oracle Core:
  Same as No Core but always carries oraclePenalty (even on wrong answers)
  oraclePenalty: Lv1=10, Lv2=30, Lv3=60 (cumulative)

Speedster Core:
  speedBonus  = max(0, floor( (1 − timeTaken/8000) × 150 ))
  pointsDelta = 100 + speedBonus         [ignores flat_buff and multiplier_buff entirely]
  Answer in 1s  → ~231 pts
  Answer in 3s  → ~193 pts
  Answer in 6s  → ~137 pts
  Answer in 8s+ →  100 pts (no speed bonus)
```

### Wrong answer penalty

```
accuracy = 1 − levenshteinDistance(typed, target) / max(len(typed), len(target))

If accuracy ≥ 80% (close miss / typo):
  penalty = max(1, distance × 2)         → small deduction

If accuracy < 80% or empty (skip):
  penalty = clamp(distance × 10, 10, 50) → larger deduction
```

## Core Stacking & Hybrid Synergy Mechanics

Future AI agents must understand how "stacking" works in Naenra. Naenra does **not** stack cores by wearing multiple cores at once. Instead, it uses a **Replacement** model combined with **Hybrid Cores**.

### 1. Upgrade = Replacement (No Mechanical Stacking)
When a player upgrades from Round 1 (`Tier 1`) to Round 2 (`Tier 2`), the old core is completely removed from the session (`active_core_id` is overwritten).
- Pure Upgrade Paths (e.g., `Power Strike` -> `Brute Force`) do not "stack" effects. The new core simply has higher mathematical multipliers and flat buffs. The old stats are discarded.

### 2. Hybrid Synergy Cores (Structural Stacking)
The game simulates stacking by offering "Hybrid Cores" at Tier 2 and Tier 3. These cores combine the code logic (mechanics) of two different core families into one single Strategy file.
- Example: `Combo Shield` (Combo + Aegis).
- A player moving from `Perfect Combo` (Round 1) to `Combo Shield` (Round 2) replaces their core. However, because `Combo Shield` internally tracks both `comboBonus` and `isShieldActive`, the player experiences a **"Mechanic Stack"** (They keep the combo mechanics AND gain shield mechanics).

### 3. Mathematical Stacking
- **Combo Stacking:** `current_combo` increments on consecutive correct answers and is multiplied by 10 (capped at 100) inside the core strategy.
- **Oracle Penalty Stacking:** Each hint click increments `oracle_reveal_level`, which exponentially increases the score penalty (-10, -30, -60) for a single word.
- **Score Modifiers:** Final score is `(100 + ComboBonus + FlatBuff) * MultiplierBuff`. (Note: Speedster ignores this entirely and overwrites the formula with a time-based calculation).

---

## Frontend: How time_taken is Tracked

```ts
// In GameplayView.vue:
const questionStartTime = ref<number>(Date.now())

// Reset on every new question:
async function loadQuestion() {
  // ...
  questionStartTime.value = Date.now()  // ← here
  gameState.value = 'playing'
}

// Captured on answer:
const timeTaken = Date.now() - questionStartTime.value
// → sent as time_taken in the POST body
```

This means **every** answer (correct, wrong, skip) always includes `time_taken`. The backend safely ignores it for cores that don't use it.

## Visual Effects (Speedster Core)

### Wind streaks (US-17.2)

6 `<span>` elements with class `.wind-streak.ws1`–`.ws6` inside `.speedster-wind-container`. Each sweeps left→right across the letter-slot area at a different speed (0.65–0.95s) and stagger. Controlled by:

```ts
// registry.ts entry:
showWindOverlay: true

// Template:
v-if="activeCoreModule.showWindOverlay && gameState === 'playing'"
```

### Timer glow (US-17.2)

Timer digit gets `.speedster-timer-glow` (pulsing cyan text-shadow).
Timer icon gets `.speedster-timer-icon` (same pulse + drop-shadow filter).
Timer color changes to `text-cyan-300` via `activeCoreModule.timerColor`.

### "+N FAST!" popup (US-17.3)

When `activeCoreModule.popupType === 'speedster'` and the answer is correct:

```ts
spawnPointPopup(data.points_earned, 'speedster')
```

The popup renders with `.speedster-fast-text` — a shimmer gradient animation on the text, and `.speedster-popup` for a dramatic upward burst (scale + skew + fade, 1.8s).

## What to Do Next (Recommended Order)

### Immediate

Speedster is fully wired. The next focus is Sprint 3.

3. **ELO update after match** — call a PATCH on `players.elo` in `timeoutSession()` using a simple Elo formula
4. **Colyseus multiplayer** — create rooms in `server/src/index.ts`, sync opponent score/progress via WebSocket
5. **Real-time opponent UI** — add opponent score bar + letter-slot shadow in `GameplayView.vue`
6. **Clean up / Delete test skip button** — delete the test "Skip to Core Selection" button (and the `skipGameplay` function) in `client/src/views/GameplayView.vue` before production.

## Rules for AI Agents

1. **Read files before editing.** Use `view_file` on any file you're about to modify.
2. **Never add `if/else` for cores in `gameController.ts`.** Use the strategy registry.
3. **Never add hardcoded core UUIDs to `GameplayView.vue`.** Use `activeCoreModule` from `getCoreModule()`.
4. **Update `CLAUDE.md`** after any significant architectural change.
5. **Update the sprint status** in `CLAUDE.md` when completing a user story.
6. **Do not commit secrets.** `.env` files are gitignored.
7. **The server is source of truth for scores.** The frontend only displays what the server returns.
8. **Anti-cheat must be preserved.** The `active_core_id` validation in `submitAnswer()` must not be removed or weakened.
9. **`time_taken` is always sent from the FE.** It is never guarded by a "if speedster core" check — all cores receive it even if they don't use it.
10. **Speedster UUID is `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000007`.** `PENDING_UUID` has been replaced in `registry.ts`. Do not revert this.
